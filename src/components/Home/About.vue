          >IX42 (Internet eXchange 42) is a large-scale experimental Internet eXchange, which aims to provide high-efficiency, low-cost and even zero-cost interconnection solutions for small and medium-sized networks, academic and experimental networks, and personal network operators distributed around the world.</p>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            At the same time, we have cooperated with many network operators to deploy the latest and quite experimental software and hardware solutions on our infrastructure.
            IX42 also offers remote peering and transport to other locations and networks as well as to other IXPs.
